================
My dad's dog eats too fast, resulting in us having to break up meals into smaller divisions. 

This program does that automatically :)

<h2> Here is a video demonstration of it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bXkFAiu2Dc </h2>

I used an Arduino Uno R2 with a CodeSheild on top of it and a 3 pin servo motor. I do not provide the cardboard cutout

dimensions, you can create it however you want.
